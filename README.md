### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello world! I'm a full-stack engineer with a passion for all things programming, computers, technology, and their effect on people's lives. My favorite part of coding is the problem-solving and getting to work with other developers on a consistent basis. 

Main competencies: JavaScript, Python, React.js, Redux, SQL, Express, Flask, HTML, CSS

Before transitioning to tech, I spent many summers working as a golf caddie, and held various past roles related to sales, advertising, and customer success. 

When I'm not hunting down and solving bugs, I enjoy reading, hiking, playing golf, and talking to friends about future goals.
